## Overview

Vectorizers in RepoLens are a core component responsible for converting code content into vector embeddings that can be used for AI-powered code understanding and analysis. These embeddings enable powerful features like semantic code search, similarity analysis, and AI-assisted code comprehension.

## Key Features

### Smart Chunking

The vectorizer automatically splits large texts into manageable chunks that fit within model token limits. This ensures that even large files can be processed effectively while maintaining semantic meaning.

### Batch Processing

The system processes multiple texts efficiently in batches, optimizing the embedding generation process and reducing API calls.

### Token Management

The system accurately counts and manages tokens to ensure optimal use of the embedding models while staying within rate limits.

### Error Handling

The vectorizer includes robust error handling for failed embedding attempts, ensuring reliability in production environments.

## Technical Details

### Vector Representations

Each embedding is a high-dimensional vector representation of the code that preserves semantic meaning. This makes them suitable for:

- Similarity search
- Code understanding tasks
- AI-powered analysis

### Chunking Strategy

The system handles both small and large files by:

- Automatically chunking content when necessary
- Supporting overlap options to maintain context between segments
- Preserving relationships between code chunks and their vector representations

### Integration

Vectorizers work as part of a pipeline alongside:

1. Fetchers (for retrieving code)
2. Parsers (for code analysis)
3. Vector storage (for later retrieval)

This integrated approach ensures that your codebase is properly prepared for AI-powered analysis while maintaining the relationships between code segments and their semantic representations.

## Available Vectorizers
