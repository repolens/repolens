---

Fetchers are a core component of RepoLens that handle the retrieval of repository content. They provide a standardized interface for accessing code from different sources, making it easy to work with repositories hosted on various platforms.

## Overview

A fetcher in RepoLens implements the `Fetcher` interface, which requires a `fetch` method that returns an array of `FetchedFile` objects. Each fetched file contains:

- `path`: The relative path of the file in the repository
- `name`: The filename
- `content`: The actual content of the file
- `sha`: A unique identifier for the file version

## Key Features

- **Standardized Interface**: All fetchers follow the same interface, making it easy to switch between different repository sources
- **Flexible Configuration**: Fetchers can be configured with options specific to their source platform
- **Content Streaming**: Efficient handling of repository content through streaming mechanisms
- **Path Filtering**: Support for including or excluding specific paths during fetching

## Available Fetchers

Currently, RepoLens provides the following fetcher implementations:

## Usage in RepoLens

Fetchers are typically used as the first step in the RepoLens pipeline, before content is passed to parsers and vectorizers. They are responsible for:

1. Connecting to the repository source
2. Downloading the relevant files
3. Organizing the content in a standardized format
4. Providing metadata like file paths and version information
