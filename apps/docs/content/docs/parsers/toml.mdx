## Overview

The TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) parser processes TOML configuration files, providing structured parsing of configuration data. It supports TOML v1.0 specification and handles all TOML data types.

## Features

- TOML v1.0 specification support
- Table and array table parsing
- Date and time handling
- Multi-line string support
- Integer and float parsing
- Comment preservation
- Dotted key support
- Array of tables

## Usage

The TOML parser is automatically selected for files with `.toml` extension. It processes TOML content and creates a structured representation.

```toml
# Server configuration
title = "My Application"
version = "1.0.0"

[server]
host = "localhost"
port = 8080
enabled = true

[database]
url = "postgresql://localhost:5432"
max_connections = 100

[[environments]]
name = "development"
debug = true

[[environments]]
name = "production"
debug = false

[dependencies]
express = "^4.17.1"
typescript = "^4.5.0"
```

## Output

The parser generates structured output that includes:

- Key-value pairs
- Tables and sub-tables
- Arrays and array tables
- Date and time values
- Numbers and strings
- Boolean values
- Comments
- Nested structures
