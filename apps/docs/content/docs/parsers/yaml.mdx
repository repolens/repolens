## Overview

The YAML parser processes YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) files, providing structured parsing of configuration and data files. It supports the YAML 1.2 specification and handles common YAML features.

## Features

- YAML 1.2 specification support
- Multi-document parsing
- Complex data structures
- Anchors and aliases
- Block and flow styles
- Comments preservation

## Usage

The YAML parser is automatically selected for files with `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions. It processes YAML content and converts it into structured data.

```yaml
# Example YAML configuration
server:
  host: localhost
  port: 3000
  settings:
    - debug: true
    - environment: development

database:
  url: postgresql://localhost:5432
  credentials:
    username: admin
```

## Output

The parser generates structured output that includes:

- Key-value pairs
- Nested structures
- Arrays and lists
- Comments
- Document metadata
