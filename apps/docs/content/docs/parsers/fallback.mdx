title: Fallback Parser
description: Fallback parser for unsupported file types
---

## Overview

The Default Parser serves as a fallback mechanism for handling files with unsupported extensions or when language-specific parsing is not required. It provides basic text chunking capabilities while maintaining file structure information.

## Features

- Universal file type support
- Basic text chunking
- Metadata preservation
- Path tracking
- Language identification
- Sequential part numbering
- Configurable chunk sizes

## Usage

The Default Parser is automatically used when:

1. A file's extension is not registered with a specific parser
2. The parser is running in 'fast' mode
3. No language-specific parser is available

```plaintext
# Example file with unsupported extension
This content will be processed by the default parser,
which will split it into manageable chunks while
preserving the original structure and metadata.

The parser will maintain:
- File path information
- Language identification (as 'plain')
- Sequential part numbering
- Original text content
```

## Output

The parser generates structured output that includes:

- Text chunks with sequential part numbers
- File path information
- Language identification (marked as 'plain')
- Chunk metadata
- Original text content
- Part index tracking

## Configuration

The Default Parser can be configured through the Parser options:

```typescript
const parser = new Parser({
  fallback: createDefaultParser(chunker),
  mode: "semantic" | "fast" | "hybrid",
});
```

When in 'fast' mode, all files will be processed by the Default Parser regardless of their extension.
