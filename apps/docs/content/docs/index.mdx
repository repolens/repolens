## Motivation

RepoLens was created to streamline the process of preparing codebases for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. It provides a unified solution to fetch, parse, and embed entire code repositories with minimal setup. By automating these crucial preprocessing steps, RepoLens enables developers to quickly transform their codebase into a format that's ready for AI-powered code understanding and analysis.
